A production-ready pipeline for target-agnostic, structure-based drug discovery. It supports automated screening of ligands against any protein target from ChEMBL, extracting 2D fingerprints, ADMET properties, and generating 3D conformers for molecular docking. Preprocessing is designed specifically to transform raw chemical and docking data into structured features suitable for structure–function modeling (e.g., predicting inhibitory concentration values such as IC₅₀).

The pipeline integrates modern machine learning methods (Transformer, XGBoost, etc.) and is built for scalable deployment with unit testing, linting, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, MLflow for experiment tracking, and Airflow for pipeline orchestration. The final predictive model is deployable via a FastAPI interface for real-time use.
